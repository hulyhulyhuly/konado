Konado is still in the early iteration stage, and its features have not yet covered all usage scenarios. We are well aware that the阶段性 limitations of the tool may bring inconvenience, and we sincerely apologize for this. We also hope that this will not overly affect your creative journey — the realization of ideas should never be hindered by the temporary limitations of tools.

If you are working on important commercial game projects, we recommend first conducting small-scale tests to confirm whether Konado adapts to your core needs; if it does not yet meet your usage scenarios, you can also prioritize more mature tools to ensure project progress.

If you are willing to continue using Konado, we sincerely appreciate your support — this will be the driving force for our continuous optimization.

May you always maintain your imagination and strive for excellence, exploring more possibilities on your creative journey.
