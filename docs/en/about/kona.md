# Mascot Kona

## About Kona
Kona is the exclusive mascot of Konado, centered around a **lively, cute, and energetic** young girl image. She is not only an important symbol of the brand's visual identity but also a friendly interactive carrier between users and Konado.


## Kona's Image
Kona's presence runs through all scenes of Konado, from the startup screen and official website homepage to product documentation, injecting vitality into the brand through her image. With Konado's version iterations, Kona's image also evolves synchronously—both fitting the design style of the new version and becoming more refined and recognizable through detailed polishing.

Usually, during **major version updates** of Konado, Kona will debut a brand-new exclusive image. Each image has unique design ingenuity, both continuing her core temperament and adding more interest and memory points to the product.

Of course, during minor version updates, Kona also has some small changes, such as changing into different seasonal costumes or adding some small accessories, making her image more diverse and rich.

The Kona image in Konado 2.0 version is particularly meticulous in detail depiction, with an overall design that is more lively and energetic, fully showcasing the freshness of a young girl:
- **Hairstyle**: Light and fluffy pink-purple short hair, with natural and flowing hair arcs, and a star-shaped hair accessory on one side—small and exquisite design like twinkling stars in the night sky, adding a touch of playfulness and dreaminess to the overall look.
- **Clothing**: Inner wear with a navy collar shirt, exuding youthful campus vibe; the bright orange bow tie at the collar cleverly breaks the monotony of the basic style. Outer layer with a light gray cardigan, soft color both balances the bright color of the inner wear and adds a casual and warm atmosphere. The lower part is a blue pleated skirt, with the hem swaying with movement, fully showcasing the girl's charming and lively temperament.
- **Accessories**: The sock design is the highlight of this image—rich in color with gradient effect, one side printed with the eye-catching "KONADO" letter logo (simple and elegant, strengthening brand association), while decorated with bright triangular geometric patterns, echoing the overall lively style and making the leg lines more dynamic. White shoes on the feet are simple and versatile, both ensuring the completeness of the look and not overpowering the main elements.
