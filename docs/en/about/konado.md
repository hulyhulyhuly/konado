# About Konado

## Project Introduction

Konado is a visual novel engine framework based on Godot Engine, driven by the open-source community. Konado is committed to providing developers with an efficient and convenient visual novel development experience, helping creators quickly build high-quality visual novel works and empowering creation.

## Konado Project

The Konado Project development team is a community-driven open-source project team belonging to the [Godot Hub](https://godothub.com) community. We are committed to the development, maintenance, and continuous development of the Konado project. All developers interested in the Konado project are welcome to join us, jointly promoting the improvement and innovation of open-source projects, and contributing to the open-source community.

## Our Goals

We are committed to independently developing a complete visual novel game framework without relying on any third-party existing solutions. Konado's goal is to create a more friendly and efficient tool, allowing game creators to focus on storytelling and artistic expression rather than getting bogged down in program implementation details.
